## Introduction
- Brief explanation of why maintaining aspect ratio is important
- What we'll achieve: a 16:9 viewport that scales properly

## 1. Basic Window Setup
- Setting up initial window configuration
- Explaining the importance of `love.conf`
- Basic window properties (width, height, resizable)
- HiDPI considerations

## 2. Establishing the Game Canvas
- Setting up base resolution (1280x720)
- Introducing viewport variables
- Initial `love.load()` setup
- Why we separate window size from game canvas size

## 3. Handling Window Resizing
- Implementing the `love.resize()` callback
- Calculating scale factors
- Understanding aspect ratio preservation
- The math behind `translateX` and `translateY`

## 4. Drawing with Transformation
- Using `push()` and `pop()` for transformation stack
- Applying translation to center the viewport
- Scaling the game canvas
- Why we need to transform before drawing

## 5. Testing and Verification
- Drawing a test rectangle
- Verifying proper scaling
- Checking corner cases (minimum size, maximum size)
- Handling different window sizes

## Code Breakdown
- Step-by-step explanation of each function
- Key concepts and formulas
- Common pitfalls to avoid

## Best Practices
- Performance considerations
- HiDPI support
- Minimum window size constraints
- Error handling

## Conclusion
- Summary of achieved functionality
- Potential improvements
- Use cases for this approach
